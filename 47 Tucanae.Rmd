In our last study of credit card transactions at domestic ATMs, we saw the different types of customers that make withdrawals at night. 
This is an exercise in exploring the associations between demographic details of these customers and making ATM withdrawals at night.

##What are we going to do?

The idea is to get a picture of the type of customers that exhibit this behavior of withdrawing from ATMs at night.

But to do this, we need to know <b><i>in what way</i></b> we will describe the customers.
<br>So let's choose variables that are as descriptive as possible.

##How are we going to do it?

All ATM transactions between 11 PM & 12 AM from 8-Oct-16 till 7-Nov-16 were extracted (just before demonetization).
Analysis was restricted to credit cards, because:

* Data availability for debit cards in data marts & data stores leaves a lot to be desired.
* ATM withdrawals, that too at night, from credit cards are relatively more intriguing.
	
The final base for analysis contained 1549 rows.

The EDW <code><font color="red">HDFC_EDW_DSE.ADMIN.FCT_FW_CI_CUSTOMER_AML_DTLS</font></code> has additional details on the customer, such as occupation details, type of employer, salary range & risk profile etc.

Our variables of interest are:

* Age of the customer (calculated from the date of birth)
* Occupation Type (_Salaried, Self-Employed, Farmer, Housewife, Student, Retired, Others_)
* Employer Type (_Government, Multinational, Partnership, Private Limited, Proprietership, Public Limited, PSUs, Not Applicable, Others_)
* Salary Range (_8 distinct levels, from 0 upto 15,00,000_)
* Risk Profiles (_LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH_)
* Count of ATM withdrawals 
* Amount of ATM withdrawals

The last two variables were calculated from the transaction base.

##So what does the data look like?

Since these are credit cards, most of them are classified as _LOW RISK_.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,plotly=TRUE,cache=FALSE,results='markup', fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
dat = data.frame(
  risk = factor(c("Low","Medium","High"), levels=c("Low","Medium","High")),
 count = c(1452,64,33))
ggplot(dat,aes(x=reorder(risk,-count),y=count))+geom_bar(stat='identity') +
 ggtitle("Risk Profiles in the data")+xlab("Risk Profile")+guides(fill=FALSE)
```

Most customers are aged between 23 to 30.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,plotly=TRUE,cache=FALSE,results='markup', fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
dat = read.csv("agefreq.csv",header=T)
ggplot(dat,aes(x=age,y=freq))+geom_line()+geom_point()+ylab("count")+ggtitle("Count of customers by age")
```

##Clustering the Customers

Clustering is a data-mining technique that groups data-points by similarity.

After choosing the appropriate number of clusters and the actual clustering algorithm, the clusters are formed.

<br>
<center><img src="C:\Users\v7184\Documents\R-wd\clusters.png"></center>
<center><b>Clusters. The numbers in the plot correspond to the row number in the actual dataset.</b></center>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,plotly=TRUE,cache=FALSE,results='markup', fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
dat = data.frame(
  Cluster = factor(c("1","2","3"), levels=c("1","2","3")),
 count = c(349,262,938))
ggplot(dat,aes(x=reorder(Cluster,count),y=count))+geom_bar(stat='identity') +
 ggtitle("No. of customers per cluster")+xlab("Cluster")+guides(fill=FALSE)
```

After correcting and regrouping the clusters, the following aspects of the clusters become apparent.

<blockquote style="background-color: #faebbc">
Cluster 1 consists of _only_ low risk, typically less than 25 years, students, 
with no information on employer available (obviously). These customers earn nothing.
Usually transact just once, very less amounts typically 10k or less.
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="background-color: #faebbc">
Cluster 2 is the least voluminous, mostly low risk, mostly between 23-50,
mostly self-employed, with no information on employer available.
Earning anywhere between 10L to 75L.
Usually transact just once,very less amounts typically 10k or less.
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="background-color: #faebbc">
Cluster 3-most voluminous, mostly low risk, mostly between 25-40,
ONLY salaried (this cluster has the most number of salaried people), mostly in Private or PSU companies.Mostly earning between 10-50L.
Usually transact just once, for very less amounts typically 10k or less.
</blockquote>

##Making Sense of the results

The following points are clear from the results:

* As the customers are mostly between 23-30, this is a strong link across the clusters. 
* All the customers have transactions just one day in the window 8-Oct-16 to 7-Nov-16 (though they may transact more than once on that day.)
* Most transactions are for low denominations, usually not more than 10k.

###So can we say that a salaried 30-year-old individual will definitely make credit cards ATM withdrawals at night?

<b>NO</b>. What this set of clusters means is that, for a given credit card ATM withdrawal at night, it is likely that the individual is a 30-year-old salaried individual. 

##What else is possible?

The conclusions above are based on the data gathered for one month. They may differ if new data is added.

Also, events like demonetization can skew the results of this exercise.
