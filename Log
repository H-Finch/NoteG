#[INFO]Data added to CSV
![WARN]Long digits like IDs truncated
#[INFO]Data reconverted to CSV, this time with Open Office
![WARN]Data summary shows mark-type values scrambled
#[INFO]Data reconverted to tab delimited file. Success!
#[INFO]Boxplots plotted per city and state show multiple values. Cleaning of these two columns required.
#[INFO]Library 'psych' needed to easliy access summaries per category
![FORK]Cleaning rows for only those cities where unauthorized usage have been historically high and separating them for analysis (1.0)
![WARN]Time read as char, converted to time format
#[INFO]Packages needed to plot per mark-type across other categories like city or hour-of-day
![FORK]To first visualize the dataset from FORK 1 (may be build dashboards with Google charts, rcharts, plotly & Shiny by RStudio??)
#[INFO]Charts shortlisted: coxcomb, sunburst, windrose & treemap
#[INFO]Hit a wall with the visualizations; almost all AMOUNT values are integers with nearly no floating values. 
#[INFO]ggplotly() viable for easy customization with good plot interactivity.
#[INFO]RMarkdowns with shiny work only inside of RStudio (at least, for now). Cannot share these markdowns freely.
#[INFO]ggplot() info: once dataframe is set in ggplot(data=''..) not necessary to set datafame again in x,y axes (like df$var1...)
#[INFO]ggplot() info: For the 'no layers' error, be sure to add geom_...()
#[INFO]ggvis()!=googleVis()
#[INFO]rCharts() also viable, to be explored subsequently.	
#[INFO]Successfully sorted bin by count and plotted treemap. Interactive treemaps to be found
#[NOTE]Treemaps describe hierarchical data. Will use a word cloud or a circular bar plot.
#[INFO]Wordclouds are tough to crack as of now and circular bar plots are a bad idea. Reverting to treemaps.
#[INFO]Finally ready, with themes and one embedded ggplotly() graph.
